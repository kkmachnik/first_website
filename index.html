                <p>Hey there! I'm Karolina, but you can just call me Karola! Originally from the vibrant city of Bielsko-Biała in Poland, I've now made Kraków my home sweet home. Nestled amidst its rich culture, myriad attractions, and breathtaking architecture, I believe Kraków is the ultimate playground for experiencing life to the fullest.</p>
                <p>As a graduate in Social Informatics from AGH University, specializing in Design and Product Development, I'm all about crafting innovative solutions. From my intriguing bachelor's thesis, <em class="names">Moodpal - a project of a mood monitoring application for people suffering from depression and experiencing low mood</em>, to my master's <em class="names">Practical application of the design process and heuristics Nielsen in the work of web designers</em>, I thrive on connecting creativity with functionality.</p>
                <p>Currently honing my website coding skills, I blend the art of user experience (UX) design from my academic background with the SEO expertise gained from my current role. In my downtime, you'll find me exploring new locales, experimenting with tantalizing recipes, burying my nose in books, and indulging in the latest TV obsessions—right now, "Ted Lasso" has me hooked for its blend of humor and insight.</p>     
                <p>And here's a <strong>quirky</strong> tidbit about me: I entered the world on a Friday—talk about kicking off the weekend with a bang!</p>

                <h2>My Skills and Experience</h2>
                <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
                    <p>I'm currently enrolled in the Front-End Engineer Path on Codecademy, where I've been actively learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, alongside gaining proficiency in Git and GitHub for version control. As part of the course, I'm diving into intermediate JavaScript and beginning modules on React, Redux, and React Router. Moreover, I've supplemented my learning with additional courses on SASS and Bootstrap. I'm committed to completing the remaining modules and eager to apply these skills in practical settings.</p>

                <h3>UX design</h3>
                <p>My academic journey has been deeply immersed in the realm of UX design, offering me comprehensive insights into user-centric principles and methodologies. Through rigorous exploration of UX research, UI design, UX writing, and testing, I've cultivated a profound understanding of crafting intuitive digital experiences. This foundation underscores my belief that prioritizing user needs is paramount for creating effective websites and applications. Notably, my master's thesis, which delved into the practical application of UX principles, was pivotal in honing my collaborative skills with UX designers. This experience not only reinforced my passion for UX but also equipped me with the ability to seamlessly integrate user insights into projects, fostering a holistic approach to design and development.</p>
                
                <h3>SEO</h3>
                <p>My experience spans across various roles in SEO, providing me with valuable insights into optimizing websites to meet the criteria set by Google algorithms. Throughout my tenure, I've been involved in planning positioning campaigns, strategizing content creation, and implementing effective link-building strategies. Additionally, I've conducted audits of clients' websites and provided recommendations on UX enhancements. This multifaceted experience has equipped me with a fundamental understanding of Google algorithms and the importance of well-optimized code in achieving higher website rankings.</p>
