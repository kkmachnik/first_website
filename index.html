                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hello, I'm Karolina but everyone calls me Karola! I'm from Bielsko-Biała in Poland, but I currently live in Kraków. I think this the perfect city to experience life with its rich culture, various attractions and beautiful architecture. I studied Social Informatics at the AGH University with specialization in Design and Product Development.
                    My bachelor's thesis title was <em class="names">"Moodpal - a project of a mood monitoring application for people suffering from depression and experiencing low mood"</em>, and my master's thesis title was <em class="names">Practical application of the design process and heuristics
                        Nielsen in the work of web designers.</em> I'm learning how to code websites, while applying good UX practices I learned at University and also SEO skills I got from my current job.
                </p>
                <p>In my freetime I really enjoy visiting new places, trying new recipes, reading books and watching tv shows. My favorite tv show at this moment is Ted Lasso, which I find funny but also really educational. I also enjoy running, but I'm learning how to di this again due to knees problems. </p>
                <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> I was born on friday!</p>

                    <summary>Good UX practices</summary>
                    <p>UX design was w huge part of my studies major. I learned a lot about good UX practices, UX research, UX and UI design, UX writing and UX testing. This I think is highly important for good working websites and applications, because if they're created for users and are easy to use then less users will have problems with them. Thia topic is really close to my heart. I took part in hackaton and won the 3rd place with the team I was in.</p>
